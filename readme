# Kubernetes Pod Diagnostics System (AI-Powered)

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Kubernetes Pod Diagnostics System** is an intelligent web-based troubleshooting assistant designed to automatically analyze and diagnose Kubernetes Pod failures.
It eliminates the need for manual `kubectl` debugging by providing real-time, human-readable explanations and actionable recommendations through an interactive chatbot interface.

This system is built to assist DevOps engineers and Kubernetes administrators in quickly identifying the root cause of pod failures such as CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff, DNS failures, scheduling issues, resource exhaustion, and more.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

* Simplify Kubernetes debugging for students and DevOps engineers
* Reduce Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR)
* Automate root-cause analysis of pod failures
* Provide user-friendly error explanations
* Support real-time Kubernetes cluster inspection

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Select Kubernetes Cluster
2. Choose Namespace
3. Select Pod
4. Chatbot fetches:

   * Pod Details
   * Events
   * Logs
5. AI engine analyzes data
6. System returns:

   * Summary
   * Likely Cause
   * Evidence
   * Recommendation
