# Kubernetes Pod Diagnostics System 🛠️🤖

## Overview

The **Kubernetes Pod Diagnostics System** is an intelligent web-based tool that analyzes Kubernetes pods and provides clear, structured diagnostics along with AI-powered explanations. It combines Kubernetes API-driven analysis with a conversational Large Language Model (LLM) to make pod troubleshooting faster, simpler, and more intuitive.

This system helps users:

* Diagnose failing or unstable pods
* Understand root causes in plain language
* Interactively discuss issues with an AI assistant
* Receive actionable remediation steps

---

## Key Features

### ✅ Real-time Pod Diagnostics

* Fetches live pod data using Kubernetes Python client
* Analyzes status, events, and logs
* Identifies common issues like:

  * CrashLoopBackOff
  * ImagePullBackOff
  * Pending / Scheduling failures
  * Network connectivity errors

### 🤖 AI-Powered Explanations (Groq LLM)

* Integrated Groq Cloud LLM for conversational troubleshooting
* Users can ask follow-up questions such as:

  * "Why is this pod failing?"
  * "How can I fix this issue?"
  * "Is this problem critical?"
* AI responses are contextual, based on real diagnostic results

### 🎯 Smart State Management

* Diagnosis runs only once per pod
* AI chat continues without re-triggering diagnostics
* Switching pods resets chat automatically for clean flow

### 🌙 Professional Dark UI

* Modern, minimal, Kubernetes-inspired layout
* Streamlit-based responsive interface
* Sidebar-driven cluster → namespace → pod selection

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SJisPro/Pod-Diagnoser.git
cd Kubernetes-Pod-Diagnostics-System
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### 4. Ensure Kubernetes Config

Make sure your kubeconfig is properly set:

```bash
kubectl config view
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## How It Works

1. User selects Cluster → Namespace → Pod
2. System analyzes the pod using Kubernetes APIs
3. Results displayed as:

   * Summary
   * Likely Cause
   * Evidence
   * Recommendation
4. User can chat with AI for further clarification
5. AI explains issues in natural language using stored diagnostics

---

## Example Use Cases

* Debugging crashing production pods
* Training junior DevOps engineers
* Understanding Kubernetes error patterns
* Quick root cause analysis during incidents

---

## Performance Optimizations

* ✅ Cached diagnostic results using Streamlit session state
* ✅ LLM queries do not re-trigger diagnostics
* ✅ Efficient cluster switching handling
* ✅ Controlled AI output length for clarity

---

## Future Enhancements

* Pod performance metrics visualization
* Auto-suggested remediation automation
* Export diagnostic reports (PDF)
* Multi-pod health dashboard
* Slack / Email alert integration

---

## Why This Project Stands Out

* Combines DevOps automation with generative AI
* Converts raw logs into human-friendly intelligence
* Improves operational efficiency
* Promotes AI-assisted infrastructure debugging
