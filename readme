# Kubernetes Pod Diagnostics System 🛠️🤖

Overview
The Kubernetes Pod Diagnostics System is an intelligent web-based tool that analyzes Kubernetes pods and provides clear, structured diagnostics along with AI-powered explanations. It combines Kubernetes API-driven analysis with a conversational Large Language Model (LLM) to make pod troubleshooting faster, simpler, and more intuitive.

This system helps users to:

* Diagnose failing or unstable pods
* Understand root causes in plain language
* Interactively discuss issues with an AI assistant
* Receive actionable remediation steps

Key Features

Real-time Pod Diagnostics

* Fetches live pod data using Kubernetes Python client
* Analyzes status, events, and logs
* Identifies common issues such as:

  * CrashLoopBackOff
  * ImagePullBackOff
  * Pending or Scheduling failures
  * Network connectivity errors

AI-Powered Explanations (Groq LLM)

* Integrated Groq Cloud LLM for conversational troubleshooting
* Users can ask follow-up questions like:

  * Why is this pod failing?
  * How can I fix this issue?
  * Is this problem critical?
* AI responses are contextual and based on real diagnostic results

Smart State Management

* Diagnosis runs only once per selected pod
* AI chat continues without re-triggering diagnostics
* Switching pods auto-resets chat for a clean experience

Professional Dark UI

* Modern Kubernetes-inspired layout
* Streamlit-based responsive interface
* Sidebar-driven Cluster → Namespace → Pod selection flow

Setup Instructions

Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SJisPro/Pod-Diagnoser.git
cd Kubernetes-Pod-Diagnostics-System

Step 2: Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a .env file and add:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here

Step 4: Verify Kubernetes Configuration

kubectl config view

Step 5: Run the Application

streamlit run app.py

Workflow Overview

1. User selects Cluster → Namespace → Pod
2. System performs automated diagnostics
3. Results displayed as:

   * Summary
   * Likely Cause
   * Evidence
   * Recommendation
4. User interacts with AI assistant
5. LLM expands and clarifies diagnostics in natural language

---

Example Use Cases

* Debugging crashing production pods
* Training junior DevOps engineers
* Incident root-cause analysis
* Kubernetes health monitoring
* Infrastructure learning tool

---

Performance Optimizations

* Cached diagnostics using session state
* AI does not re-trigger diagnostics
* Efficient pod switching handling
* Controlled response length for readability

---

Future Enhancements

* Pod performance graphs
* Automatic remediation suggestions
* Exportable PDF diagnostic reports
* Multi-pod monitoring dashboard
* Slack and email alerts

---

Why This Project Stands Out

* Combines DevOps automation with Generative AI
* Converts raw Kubernetes logs into human-readable insights
* Enables faster troubleshooting
* Demonstrates practical AI integration in infrastructure systems
